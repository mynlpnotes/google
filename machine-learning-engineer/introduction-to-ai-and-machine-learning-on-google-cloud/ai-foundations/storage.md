# Storage

* Compute and storage are decoupled for proper scaling
* With cloud computing, compute and storage can scale separately
* Cloud storage, Big table, Cloud SQL, Big Query etc
* Unstructured data is mostly stored in cloud storage
* Cloud storage types:
  * Standard storage - Hot data - For data that is stored only for brief period
  * Nearline storage - Once per month read or write - Data backup
  * Coldline storage - Once every 90 dats
  * Archive storage - Once a year
