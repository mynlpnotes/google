* Google has been an AI-first company and used AI to power its products since the beginning
* Google is a leader in AI and ML innovations.
* Google is a believer in responsible&#x20;
* Data is the basis of AI
* As a search engine, Google needed to constantly invent new data processing methods to index the World Wide Web and keep up with the rapidly growing internet.
* The innovation started in the early 2000s from Google File System, or GFS, which is the foundation for Cloud Storage, and MapReduce, which aims to manage large-scale data processing.
* To address the challenges of different types of data, whether structured or unstructured, and different processing requirements, either streaming or batch, Google has continued to invent multiple products and technologies in data analytics and engineering.
* For example, BigQuery, the data warehouse widely used on Google Cloud, can analyze large amounts of data and build ML models at the same time with SQL, Structured Query Language.
* In 2015, Pub/Sub was invented to help build data pipelines for streaming analytics.

* The widely-used ML library in Python for general purposes scikit-learn was a Google summer coding project back in 2007
* TensorFlow, an open-source ML platform for training deep learning neural networks was developed by Google in 2015
* The transformer, the basis of all generative AI (or gen AI) applications seen today, was invented by Google in 2017.
* From this, large language models evolved rapidly, including Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in 2018, Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) in 2021, Pathways Language Model (PaLM) in 2022, Gemini, the most recent cutting-edge genAI model to process multimodal data released at the end of 2023, and Gemma, an open model released at the beginning of 2024.
* In terms of AI products, Google built an end-to-end AI development platform that evolves from AutoML in 2018, to Al Platform in 2019, and Vertex AI in 2021.
* Google also announced a series of generative AI products on Vertex AI such as Vertex AI Studio, Model Garden, and Search and Conversation.
* Google is a leader in AI and ML innovations.
* Here are four major reasons:&#x20;
  * The ML development platform is empowered by Google's state-of-the-art ML models.
  * Google provides an end-to-end development platform to convert an ML model from experiment to production so you can be more efficient.
  * Google provides a unified data-to-AI platform so you can develop data and AI projects with ease.
  * Like Google Cloud itself, AI services are based on an efficient and scalable infrastructure so you can get more for less.
* Responsible AI refers to the development and use of artificial intelligence systems in a way that prioritizes ethical considerations, fairness, accountability, safety, and transparency.\
