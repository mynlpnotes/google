# Pre-trained APIs

* Good ML model requires lots of high quality training data
* We need hundred of thousands of records to train a custom model
* If we don't have such data then we can use pre-trained model
* In this we only need to know how to fit the API without worrying about its implementation
* Pre-trained APIs are offered as a service
* They save the time to build, curate and training databases
* Can just directly deal with predictions
